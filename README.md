# ðŸš€ Welcome to Lukso power-up tags project!

## Intro
Custom elements are reusable web components built using JavaScript that extend the HTML vocabulary. They allow you to define your own elements with specific behaviors and styles, encapsulating functionality.

## Benefits in Dapps
- **Modularization**: 
Break down complex Dapp interfaces into smaller, reusable elements for cleaner code and easier maintenance.

- **Reusability**: Share common UI components across different Dapp sections or even multiple Dapps.

- **Encapsulation**: Keep logic and data within each element, promoting better organization and reducing code complexity.
Improved developer experience: Build complex interfaces with familiar web development concepts.
